# Development & Releases

## Scripts

```bash
npm install
npm test           # unit tests (node:test) for all pure logic
npm run build      # bundle to dist/
npm run zip        # build + store zips in artifacts/
npm run watch      # rebuild bundles on change
npm run media      # regenerate the README screenshots + demo GIF
npm run icons      # regenerate icons (deterministic, dependency-free)
node harness/serve.mjs   # http://localhost:8631/acme/widget — fixture repo page
```

## Architecture

Pure logic (path resolution, frontmatter, slugs, docs collection, wiki-link resolution, search, markdown plugins, cache policy) lives in ESM modules under `src/common/` and `src/content/`, and is covered by unit tests. Browser integration (tab injection, viewer, routing) is verified through the harness.

> [!NOTE]
> The **harness** serves a fake GitHub repo page with stubbed `chrome.storage` and GitHub APIs, so the full content script can be exercised in a plain browser tab — no extension install needed.

The `docs/` folder is user documentation **and** doubles as the extension's live showcase: every feature in these pages (frontmatter titles, tags, pinned docs, wiki links, alerts) renders when you open this repo's own Docs tab.

## Continuous integration

Every push and pull request runs the **CI** workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): unit tests, a full build, bundle syntax checks, and manifest validation.

## Releases

The **Release** workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) builds the Chrome and Firefox zips, generates change notes from the commits since the previous tag, and publishes a GitHub Release with the zips attached. Two ways to cut one:

- **Tag push** — bump `version` in `manifest.json` and `package.json`, commit, then:
  ```bash
  git tag v0.2.1 && git push origin v0.2.1
  ```
  The workflow verifies the tag matches the manifest version, then builds and publishes.
- **Manual dispatch** — **Actions → Release → Run workflow**, enter a version (e.g. `0.2.1`). It bumps the version files, commits, tags, builds, and publishes in one go.

Grab the attached zip from any release and load it — see [[Installation Guide]].
